      <description>our goal with this project is to analyse a risk-return relationship of stocks of our choice in order to see which ones should we buy given a specific level of risk aversion. to achieve this goal, we will need to calculate some measurements using descriptive statistics and to plot a few charts.
firstly, we load a dataset nyse.csv containing 508 stocks listed on the new york stock exchange, their unique ticker symbol and name, the ipo_year (initial public offering), as well as the sector and industry the company is in.</description>
