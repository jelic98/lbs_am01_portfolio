      <description>how i have seen one of unethical barriers interfere with ethical behaviour in the past?    to illustrate one type of unethical barrier, named by the authors as “ill-conceived goals” (bazerman and tenbrunsel, 2011), the following paragraph describes a particular behavioural pattern present within customer support teams or individuals focused on quantity rather than quality, i.e., oriented to maximizing the number of positive feedbacks rather than to increasing customer satisfaction.</description>
